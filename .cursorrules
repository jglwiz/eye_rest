## Code Guidelines
- Maintain clean, readable Python code
- Follow existing project structure in the `src/` directory
- Use the established logging and configuration patterns
- Preserve the modular architecture with separate lib components

## Testing and Execution
- Before any test execution: `conda activate eye`
- Ensure all dependencies are available in the conda environment
- Test the application thoroughly before building executables

## Build Process
- Use the provided PowerShell scripts for building executables
- Follow the established deployment process via `deploy.ps1`
- Maintain compatibility with Windows 11 environment

## File Management
- Respect the existing project structure
- Keep configuration files (`.json`) in the root directory
- Maintain separation between source code (`src/`) and documentation (`doc/`)
- Use appropriate logging directory structure

## Communication
- Always respond in Chinese with English punctuation
- Provide clear, concise explanations for code changes
- Document any significant architectural decisions
